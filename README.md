# Telecom Churn Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Telecom Churn Analysis project! This project aims to predict customer churn behavior in the telecommunications industry. Churn prediction is crucial for retaining existing customers, as it costs significantly more to acquire new customers than to retain current ones. In this project, we analyze customer data and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Churn Prediction**: Develop predictive models to identify customers likely to churn.

2. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Feature Importance**: Determine the most important features influencing churn prediction.

4. **Optimization**: Optimize model parameters to achieve the best possible performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling class imbalance.

2. **Model Building**: Building and evaluating predictive models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and boosting algorithms.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model parameters to improve performance.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying key features affecting churn prediction.
